Business Process Improvement
DuraBante uses Lean Six Sigma and Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) methodologies to 
improve and redesign processes to make them faster, better, and cheaper. We go one 
step beyond the traditional Six Sigma techniques by developing procedures, reference 
guides, and training to successfully control the improved processes and make them 
sustainable.
Training, Mentoring, and Coaching
DuraBante’s Training Program is designed to meet the needs of today’s businesses with core 
offerings centered around communication, project management, and Lean Six Sigma. Our 
field experience keeps training relevant, understandable, and applicable. Lessons learned 
can be applied immediately and successfully in the workplace. One-on-one mentoring is 
available as part of the training program, as well as a separate class for those that want to 
hone a particular skill.
Procedure Program Development
DuraBante’s professional program and procedure management team develops  “Human 
Factored”  procedures and implements quality programs using Procedure Professional 
Association guidelines. With the increased need to prove compliance and safety, 
standardization and procedures are crucial. Incorporating  “Human Performance Tools”  
such as  “Peer Checking”  and  “Three-Way Communication”  with procedures that have 
been  “Human Factored”  for clarity greatly mitigates the potential for errors and injuries.

marathon life sciences (marathon ls) is a team of manufacturer-trained service engineers who 
utilize 85+ years of maintenance, repairs, and calibration of laboratory equipment experience.  
our main goal is long-term equipment efficiency.  we also stock laboratory consumables, which 
offers a stable supply chain and allows us to deliver an unparalleled experience for clients. 
our team relies on thorough communication and clearly set expectations to deliver exemplary 
customer service. we understand that delays resulting from sourcing difficulties can have large 
impacts on productivity, especially when it comes to the students or employees relying on 
necessary laboratory supplies. we want to ensure that you lose as little time as possible to 
maintain efficiency. 
laboratory supplies 
marathon ls’ lab supplies line includes dishes, flasks, strainers and 
filtration products, tubes, plates and reservoirs, pipets and pipette 
tips, and pcr strips and tubes. we frequently update the products 
we offer and are committed to improvement by customer-driven 
feedback.  if you need a laboratory product we do not currently 
provide, our customer service experts will help you find what you 
are looking for. 
because we produce our own branded products, we have 
extensive knowledge regarding lab supplies and can provide 
high quality materials without the need for a middleman.  all 
products we offer, we have immediate access to. this results in 
speedier delivery times to get clients the supplies they need.  
we understand that efficiency and quality are both equally 
important for success, and the ability to source in-demand, 
sometimes hard to obtain products sets us apart. 
as a smaller company, marathon ls is more in control of the supplies we provide our 
customers. we have a strong focus on customer service, quick response times, and you’ll be 
working with the same dedicated team of individuals every time.  we’ve also begun the process

capabilities statement 
redc invents and manufactures clean energy technologies that help 
solve some of the world’s most pressing issues today. our technologies 
serve the needs of those in developed and developing nations. we tackle 
difficult problems, such as; climate change, malnutrition, food security, 
irrigation, rural electrification and clean water. 
naics codes: 22111, 335220, subsector 335 
 
redc’s hydrokinetic prime mover: converts the hydrokinetic energy from flowing water into mechanical energy with 
little to if any impact on the environment. the mechanical energy is used to pump water uphill for energy storage and irrigation. 
water current is deflected by the fender into buckets and away from the returning collapsed buckets. the buckets pull a chain 
around sprockets, which turn a set of gears and a shaft. the shaft is connected to a centrifugal pump for uphill water pumping.  
rural communities that are located close to flowing rivers and mountains now have the ability to create reliable, carbon-free energy 
24 hours a day with our hydrokinetic pumped energy storage system. dams become more efficient by recouping waste energy for 
reuse. small-scale farmers in developing nations now have the ability to irrigate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. 
redc’s solar food preservation facility: (sfpf) preserves nutritious foods long-term for small-scale farmers in 
developing nations without needing access to electricity. the sfpf comes equipped with a walk-in cooler for short-term storage of 
nutritious foods. the glass jar canning room helps farmers create new products for their businesses. the preserved, fresh food 
provides community members with low-cost, nutritious food year round. pregnant and nursing mothers can now provide their 
children with the proper micronutrients a growing body requires. ",,

eagle6 imports differing types of enterprise 
data (network logs, source code, config files, 
database schemas, etc.) and builds a model 
of the enterprise, its actors, and how entities in 
the enterprise collect and share data.  using 
ml and ai, eagle6 is capable of identifying 
anomalous behavior that may indicate cyber activity and generates automated dashboards and 
reports that identify the impact of the unwanted behavior to critical mission systems. 
 
secure office (2021 beta release) is a 
document management cyber security product 
that focuses on protecting classified 
information using machine learning, artificial 
intelligence, customizable access controls, 
and in-document need-to-know (n2k) 
security.  the tool has editors for documents, 
spreadsheets, and presentations, and also includes a whiteboard editor.  all tools utilize our 
secure drive document repository that is specifically designed for access control integration.
